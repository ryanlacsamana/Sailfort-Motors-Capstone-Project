# Sailfort-Motors-Capstone-Project
### **Scenario**

Sailfort Motors are currently having a high rate of turnover. Since Sailfort Motors invest in recruiting, training, and upskilling their employees, the impact of high turnover rate is costly in the financial sense. The HR department were tasked by the leadership team of Sailfort Motors to collect sample data from the employees on what might be the cause of high turnovers. The leadership also tasked you to analyze the survey data and design a model to predict employee departure.

_Note: Turnover data includes both employees who choose to quit their job and employees who are let go._

The task also involves identifying the factors that contribute to employee departure. The model will be beneficial to the company by increasing retention rate and job satisfaction of employees.

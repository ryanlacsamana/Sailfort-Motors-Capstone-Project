# Sailfort-Motors-Capstone-Project
### **Scenario**

Sailfort Motors are currently having a high rate of turnover. Since Sailfort Motors invest in recruiting, training, and upskilling their employees, the impact of high turnover rate is costly in the financial sense. The HR department were tasked by the leadership team of Sailfort Motors to collect sample data from the employees on what might be the cause of high turnovers. The leadership also tasked you to analyze the survey data and design a model to predict employee departure.

_Note: Turnover data includes both employees who choose to quit their job and employees who are let go._

The task also involves identifying the factors that contribute to employee departure. The model will be beneficial to the company by increasing retention rate and job satisfaction of employees.

- **Issue/Problem**
  - Sailfort Motors seeks to improve employee retention.
- **Response**
  - Since the variable to be predicted is **_categorical_**, a logistic regression or tree-based machine learning model will be used.
- **Impact**
  - The model will help predict employee departure and the factors that causes it. The HR can also devise a plan to prevent departures and improve employee retention.

### **Familiarization of the HR Dataset**

The dataset was provided by Google Certificates, but can also be downloaded in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaisalqureshi/hr-analytics-and-job-prediction?select=HR_comma_sep.csv). The dataset contains 14,999 rows and 10 columns. Shown below are the variables used in the dataset and its corresponding description.
Variable  |Description |
-----|-----| 
satisfaction_level|Employee-reported job satisfaction level [0&ndash;1]|
last_evaluation|Score of employee's last performance review [0&ndash;1]|
number_project|Number of projects employee contributes to|
average_monthly_hours|Average number of hours employee worked per month|
time_spend_company|How long the employee has been with the company (years)
Work_accident|Whether or not the employee experienced an accident while at work
left|Whether or not the employee left the company
promotion_last_5years|Whether or not the employee was promoted in the last 5 years
Department|The employee's department
salary|The employee's salary (U.S. dollars)
